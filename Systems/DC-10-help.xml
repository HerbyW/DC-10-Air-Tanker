WATER BOMBER DC-10 Air Tanker Version: 1.0.1 by Herbert Wagner (HerbyW) 2018
***** Based on the wonderful work of Ryan Miller: DC-10-30 *****

Press s for autostart.

Filling of the water tank ( 45000 liters):

Now you may simulate a water bombing
=> At a low agl, 200-500 ft, over the target which is supposed to be bombed,
=> release the water (command key 'l" like "l"etter)
The water can be seen falling down.
    
The  aircraft is right now 45000 kg less, it will jump upper in the sky, be prepared for it.
When empty don't forget to close the water tank doors ( key"D")

Planned:

There are 3 placards in the middle panel: red, blue, white with description, so you do not need the shortcuts :)
    
Make fire in MP-Modus:
Activate all buttons in the Wildfire settings, to see the wildfire
(in this model is it done at startup automatically, for multiplayer each player has to set it to see it).
Press: Strg + Shift + click on the ground to make a fire, be aware that each fire gets bigger in time.

Refulling can only be done at ground, open the menue: Refuel


All animations in multiplayer!

Have fun! HerbyW 2018
