WATER BOMBER DC-10 Air Tanker Version: 2.0.0 by Herbert Wagner (HerbyW) 2018
***** Based on the wonderful work of Ryan Miller: DC-10-30 *****

Press s for autostart at least 10 seconds.

For functions of the autopilot see the wiki page:
http://wiki.flightgear.org/McDonnell_Douglas_DC-10-30

All knobs are now updated to be used with +Shift to scroll quicker.

Filling of the retardant tanks ( 45000 liters) can only be done at ground: Press "w"

Simulation of retardand dropping:

Set amount and coverage level:
At the middle panel you see the controls for dumping amount,
set it to 25-100% on all 3 tanks.
The coverage level can be set from 1 to 8.
Depending on this setting the amount of dropping water per second is set.

100% amount at level 8 drops 45000 liter in 8 seconds.
100% amount at level 1 drops 45000 liter in 32 seconds.

=> At a low agl, 200-300 ft, over the target which is supposed to be bombed,
=> release the water (command key 'l" like "l"etter) or use the release button at the control panel.
The water can be seen falling down.
On ground will be the retardant visible,
this tiles are now unflamable and any fire will be out.
You may bomb borders around the fire to stop it from expanding.
Each fire will burn out in a few minutes. But they will expand rapidly.
    
The  aircraft is right now 50000 kg less, it will jump upper in the sky, be prepared for it.
The water tank doors ( key"D") will be closed automatically after dumping.
You may use this function to stop dumping at any moment!

How to make fire in MP-Modus:
Activate all buttons in the Wildfire settings, to see the wildfire.
(In this model is it done at startup automatically, for multiplayer each player has to set it to see it).
Press: Strg + Shift + click on the ground to make a fire, be aware that each fire gets bigger in time.
You can make only one fire every 4 seconds! If you make more than it will not be transmitted over the Multiplayer.


All animations in multiplayer!
